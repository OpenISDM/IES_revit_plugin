# IES Beacon Plugin for Autodesk Revit

## Project Description from Jane

"Graphical tools built on the geometric model can:

1. Help the developer select the right type of beacons for each place,
2. Experiment with the placements and orientations of the selected beacons,
3. Visualize and assess the coverage provided by them,
4. Generate the coordinates and technical specifications of the beacons."
